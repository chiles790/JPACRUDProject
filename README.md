# JPA CRUD Project
### Overview
Our first try at building a solo full stack web app that has CRUD functions. The difference between last weekends group project and this weekends application is we created our own Database as well as the knowledge we acquired of JPQL queries.

My Database has the Super Bowl titles starting from 2000 through present day, I originally was going to do all Super Bowl titles but since there are 50+ titles I decided in the interest of time as well as to give myself and others that use my application the ability to add older Super Bowl's and predict or "choose" who will win in future years.

### Skills used
* JUNIT tests
* JPQL
* MySQL WorkBench
* SpringToolSuite4
* Database creation
* Tag Libraries
* JSP

### How to run
As we have setup our application to run on localhost:8082, navigate to that webpage or run the application in your STS4.
1) You are able to search the table by Super Bowl title (id)
2) When you get a result you are able to use the delete, and update options to update all columns or delete the entire row.
3) You are also prompted on the "home" page to create/add a new Super Bowl to the list.
